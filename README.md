Google calendar only shows your contact's birthdays, but doesn't have the option to notify you. With this web application you will get reminder mails for your contact's birthdays.

You can do it yourself, by downloading the BirthdayReminder.json file and adding it to Google Drive. Then open it with Google Apps Script and publish the project as webapp.
